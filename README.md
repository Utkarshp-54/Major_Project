# Development of a Mobile Robot for Environmental Inspection in Hazardous Terrains

This project focuses on the design and development of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) engineered to autonomously navigate and inspect hazardous terrains. Equipped with advanced sensors and computer vision capabilities, the robot performs real-time environmental monitoring, obstacle avoidance, and data analysis, providing a reliable solution for areas unsafe for human intervention.

## Features
**Autonomous Navigation:** Utilizes sensor fusion and path planning algorithms for obstacle detection and avoidance.

**Real-Time Video Streaming:** Streams live video feeds to a web interface via an onboard server.

**Data Augmentation:** Automatically augments detected unknown objects to enhance the training dataset.

**Computer Vision:** Implements object detection, classification, and segmentation using advanced algorithms.

**Image Enhancement:** Employs Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) for high-quality image reconstruction.

**Extended Communication:** Establishes a LAN-based communication protocol with chained WiFi modules for long-range control

## Technologies Used
**Programming Languages:** C++, Python

**Libraries & Frameworks:** OpenCV, Flask, TensorFlow

**Networking:** Custom LAN protocol with WiFi modules

**Machine Learning:** ESRGAN for image enhancement
